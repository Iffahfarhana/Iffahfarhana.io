<p>offer beautiful 360 degree view of it surrounding.my friends and i went hiking on the semester

<td><p>There is only one trail up Gunung Baling which is straightforward and pretty well-marked.
<p>Along the way there are signage and lamp marker to guide you through. From the carpark, the 
<p>trek up Gunung Baling is about 1.85km long with a height elevation of around 450m.The entrance
<p>to the start of the trail is at the end of the carpark.The first 400m of the hike are spent
<p>walking up 30 to 45 degrees lopes on soil/muddy trails. The soil/muddy trail can be slippery
<p>after rain or heavy downpour. At the stepper sections, there are handrails for support.
<p>After this section, the trail turns flat/gradual for the next 300 meters, most predominately
<p>walking up a flight of stairs and through the jungle trails.</p></td>

<td><p>For the last 1.1km, the trail continues to go up and gradually the terrain becomes more and
<p>more rocky. Nearing the last part of the jungle trail, you will need to climb up a rock obstacle
<p>and crawl under some rocks to reach the ridge line. Enjoy the view and walk on the ridge line to 
<p>reach the summit.The view on the mountain is very beautiful and comfortable, we spent time recording
<p>the moment on there. Eventhough, its quite tired and needs a lot of energy, but its very satisfied with
<p>the beautifuls view on the top of the Baling Mountain.</td><p>

<td><p>Having this moment are the best experience i have in my life, because i have a lot of fun with my
<p>friends and at the same time i can see the beautiful view on the top of Baling Mountain. Next, i will
<p>challenge my self to go more adventures place. Hiking is a bit like life, The Journey only requires you
<p>to put one foot in front of the other..Again and again... And if you allow yourself opportunity to be 
<p>present throughout the entirety of the trek, you will witness beauty every step of the way, not just at the summit.</p></td>
